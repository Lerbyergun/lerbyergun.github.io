I am a senior economist at the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/">Bank of Canada</a>, specializing in empirical research in financial markets.
My primary focus is on studying extreme events through extreme value theory and option pricing.
In my research, I develop and apply tools from these fields to gain insights into investor behavior and
perceptions of market conditions. Additionally, I have a strong interest in liquidity and the information
structures of over-the-counter markets. My research explores the impact of public information and
monetary policy on market quality in opaque markets, such as the derivative, bond, repo, and securities lending markets.
For a more detailed overview of my papers and ongoing research, please refer to the research section or my resume
